## Executive Summary

This project presents the current and future trends in programming languages and databases, with a detailed review of:

- Current technology usage
- Future technology trends
- Demographics of the analyzed data

## Introduction

The analysis is based on data from the Stack Overflow Developer 2019 Survey and focuses on answering the following key questions:

1. What are the top 5 programming languages currently used by respondents?
2. What are the top 5 programming languages they want to learn next year?
3. What are the top 5 databases currently used by respondents?
4. What are the top 5 databases they want to learn next year?

## Methodology

The data analysis involved:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - APIs and web scraping techniques were used to gather the survey data.
   
2. **Data Wrangling**:
   - Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing the data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identifying data distributions, outliers, and correlations.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualizing the distribution of languages and databases.

5. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - An interactive dashboard was created to visualize the findings.

## Results

### Programming Language Trends

- **Current Top 3**: JavaScript, Java, Python
- **Future Predictions**: HTML/CSS, Typescript, C#
- **Findings**: Python is becoming essential for developers, while web developers should focus on skills like Typescript and modern web frameworks (e.g., React.js, Angular).

### Database Trends

- **Current Top 3**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- **Future Predictions**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL
- **Findings**: PostgreSQL is rising in popularity, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB are becoming more significant in the coming years.

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to demonstrate the trends found in the data, including:

- **Programming Language Popularity** (Bar Charts, Line Charts)
- **Database Usage Trends** (Boxplots, Line Charts)

## Discussion

Key questions discussed in the project include:

- Will JavaScript and Python dominate the next decade?
- Should developers focus on one language or learn multiple?
- Is the web development market oversaturated?

## Conclusion

- JavaScript, HTML/CSS remain dominant, but Python, Typescript, and Go will continue to rise in the future.
- The demand for skills related to these technologies is increasing, as companies adopt more modern databases and frameworks.

## Appendix

- Demographics of respondents (Age, Job Title, etc.)
- Correlation between age and technology trends.

## Project Dashboard

An interactive dashboard has been created for further exploration of the findings. It can be accessed [here](https://github.com/16Brijesh10/Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project).
